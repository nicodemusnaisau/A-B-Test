## A/B Test of New Design

---

## Background Project

- The company is considering implementing a new design for its product. However, the effectiveness of the new design is uncertain. In order to make an informed decision about whether to implement the new design, it is important to determine whether it is significantly different from the current design in terms of performance.

---

## Problem Statement

- To determine whether the new design is significantly different from the current design in terms of performance.

---

## Method

- A two-tailed A/B test was conducted with a confidence level of 95%. The sample size was 4720. The null hypothesis stated that there is no difference between the two designs in terms of performance. The alternative hypothesis stated that the new design is significantly different from the current design in terms of performance.

## Results

- The p-value for the test was 0.732, which is above the alpha level of 0.05. Therefore, **we cannot reject the null hypothesis**.
- This suggests that the **new design is not significantly different from the current design** in terms of performance.
